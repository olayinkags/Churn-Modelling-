Business Problem: Customer Churn in a Bank

Background: A fictional bank operating in Europe, with customers in France, Spain, and Germany, is facing a significant challenge of high churn rates among its customers. Churn refers to customers leaving the bank, and the management has observed an unusual increase in customer exits. The bank has hired a data scientist to analyze a dataset containing information about 10,000 randomly selected customers, collected six months ago. The goal is to understand the factors influencing customer churn and develop a geodemographic segmentation model to identify customers at the highest risk of leaving.

Dataset Overview:

Columns:
Row Number, Customer ID, Surname (Identifiers)
Credit Score, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure (Demographic Information)
Balance, Number of Products, Has Credit Card, Is Active Member, Estimated Salary (Financial Information)
Exited (Binary Outcome: 1 if customer left, 0 if customer stayed)
Business Objectives:

Identify Factors Influencing Churn:

Analyze the dataset to understand which customer attributes and behaviors are correlated with churn.
Determine if factors like credit score, geography, age, tenure, and financial information impact customer retention.
Develop Geodemographic Segmentation Model:

Build a geodemographic segmentation model to categorize customers based on their likelihood of leaving the bank.
Use machine learning techniques to create a predictive model that considers various features to identify high-risk customers.
Evaluate Model Performance:

Assess the model's accuracy to ensure it effectively predicts customer churn.
Validate the model using the validation dataset to confirm its generalizability.
